A selection of configuration files used in Bash.

- `aliases` => `~/.bash_aliases` contains useful commands be used in the terminal
- `motd` => `~/.bash_profile` is a Raspberry Pi themed MOTD file and will be shown when an SSH session is initiated.
- `bashrc` => `~/.bashrc` has colours turned on and a few history tweaks.
- `rc.local` => `/etc/rc.local` file I use on my Chromebook to enable me to use X applications in Chrome OS.
