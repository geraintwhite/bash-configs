Bash Config Files
=================

A selection of configuration files used in Bash.

- aliases contains useful commands be used in the terminal (should be renamed to .bash_aliases and placed in home directory).
- motd is a Raspberry Pi themed MOTD file which should be saved as ~/.bash_profile and will be shown when an SSH session is initiated.
- bashrc is a customised ~/.bashrc file which has colours turned on and a few history tweaks.
- rc.local is the /etc/rc.local file I use on my Chromebook to enable me to use X applications in Chrome OS.
